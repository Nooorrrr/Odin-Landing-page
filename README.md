# Odin-Landing-page
This is my first html/css project with no tutorials no help no googling (well i did peek at some code I wrote previousily but seriously who doesnt do that), it' s a simple landing page.    
It made me practise flexbox proparties which i always thought were hard when in reality they are very simple and fun to use.     
I thought of personalizing it but then got lazy and went with the default Odin Project theme.        
The idea of this landing page is to work each section on it own starting from top to bottom (well I should' ve used section tags instead of divs but i made it work with divs anyway)       
This landing page is NOT responsive for other devices since it wanst required by the task
